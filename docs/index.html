  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Project: Starfighter is an old school 2D shoot 'em up. In the
  game you take on the role of a rebel pilot called Chris, who is
  attempting to overthrow a military corporation called Weapco.
  Weapco has seized control of the known universe and currently
  rules it with an iron fist. Chris can no longer stand back and
  watch as millions of people suffer and die. He steals an
  experimental craft known as "Firefly" and begins his mission to
  fight his way to Sol, freeing key systems along the way. The game
  opens with Chris attempting to escape a Weapco patrol that has
  intercepted him.</p>

  <h2>How to Play</h2>

  <p>When first starting Project: Starfighter you will see the text
  scrolling introduction. You can either wait for this to finish or
  you can skip it by pressing ctrl or space.</p>

  <p>The title sequence will begin. Once the menu is shown (or you
  opt to skip to it by pressing space or ctrl) you may select from
  the options shown:</p>

  <ul class="menu">
  <li>Start New Game</li>
  <li>Load Game</li>
  <li>Continue Current Game</li>
  <li>Options</li>
  <li>Quit</li>
  </ul>

  <dl>
  <dt>Start New Game</dt>
  <dd>This will start a new game.</dd>

  <dt>Load Game</dt>
  <dd>This will bring up a list of currently available games to be
  loaded.</dd>

  <dt>Continue Current Game</dt>
  <dd>This will load the Autosave slot. It is only shown if an autosave is available.</dd>

  <dt>Options</dt>
  <dd>This will show a list of game options.</dd>

  <dt>Quit</dt>
  <dd>This will quit the game.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Loading and Saving Games</h2>

  <p>Games can be loaded from the title screen.</p>

  <p>Games can be saved on the Intermission screen. Move the cursor to the Save Game
  icon and select it. You will see a list of five game slots that
  can be used to save a game to. Click one of these and then click
  the "Save" button to save the game.</p>

  <p>The current game is also automatically saved to the Autosave slot.</p>

  <h2>Getting Missions</h2>

  <p>In each System, the player can get missions by going to the
  Missions section of the Intermission screen. Here allies will inform
  you of tasks that need to be performed and what planet these
  tasks apply to. Once the player has decided which task they will
  perform, they must go to the corresponding planet in the system
  (see Moving Around for more details). Once stationed at the
  planet click "Start Mission" to proceed to the mission briefing
  screen. The "Start Mission" icon will not be shown if the mission
  of the planet has been completed.</p>

  <h2>Mission Briefing</h2>

  <p>Before the beginning of each mission you will be presented
  with a mission briefing screen. This will outline the mission's
  primary and (if any) secondary objectives. It will also inform
  you of mission restrictions, such as time limits. Once you have
  read this, press ctrl or space to continue</p>

  <h2>Completing Missions</h2>

  <p>Each mission in the game has one or more objectives tied to
  it. These objectives are either Primary or Secondary objectives.
  In order to complete the mission, the player must complete all
  the primary mission objectives. For example, when the game begins
  Chris is fleeing a WEAPCO patrol. The primary objective for this
  mission is to destroy all the enemy fighters. Once this is
  achieved the Firefly will leave the sector and the mission will
  be marked as a success.</p>

  <p>One thing to note is that some missions will have both Primary
  and Secondary objectives. In this case, the Firefly does not
  leave the sector if all primary mission objectives are complete
  and secondary objectives remain. The player may then attempt to
  complete remaining secondary objectives or press Escape to leave
  the sector. Secondary objectives are optional.</p>

  <p>During the mission you will see messages appearing at the
  bottom of the screen. These messages can be related to items that
  you pick up, as well as mission related information.</p>

  <ul>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF">White messages</font> are standard for picking up items such as cash and power ups.</li>
  <li><font color="#00FF00">Green messages</font> signify successful completion of mission objectives.</li>
  <li><font color="#00FFFF">Light Blue messages</font> give further details about Primary mission requirements.</li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000">Red messages</font> indicate mission failures, warnings and wing mate ejections.</li>
  <li><font color="#FFFF00">Yellow messages</font> give further details about Secondary mission requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Moving Around Systems</h2>

  <p>To play a mission in Starfighter you must be stationed at the
  relevant planet. To get to the planet you require, you will need
  to select a planet to
  travel to by clicking on it with the mouse. "Destination",
  followed by the planet's name will appear in the bottom right
  hand corner of the screen. A new icon labelled "Go To
  Destination" will also appear. Clicking this icon will make the
  player travel to the destination planet.</p>

  <p>Travelling to new planets is represented at the bottom of the
  screen by the two planets (the one being travelled from and the
  one being travelled to). A red bar will fill up as the journey
  progresses. The speed the bar fills up will vary occurring to how
  far away the planets are from one another. At any point during
  this time the planet can be intercepted (see Interceptions). Once
  the red bar has filled up completely the journey will be
  completed and you will be stationed that the new planet.</p>

  <h2>Interceptions</h2>

  <p>Interceptions can take place whilst travelling between two
  planets within a system. When the player is intercepted they will
  go directly into a mission-like scenario. The objective of this
  interception is to clear all attacking forces. Once this is done,
  the player will be free to leave.</p>

  <p>Interceptions also serve other purposes - Sometimes the WEAPCO
  patrol may have slave transports with them. One of the objectives
  of a later system is to rescue a certain amount of slaves. This
  is only possible during interceptions.</p>

  <p>One important thing to remember is that any damage the player
  receives during an interception will NOT be repaired until they
  have reached the destination planet. Therefore if the player is
  heavily damaged during one interception that damage will still be
  present if they are attacked again. This can make interceptions
  very dangerous.</p>

  <h2>Weaponry and Upgrades</h2>

  <p>During the course of the game you will receive money. Money is
  gained from picking up cash spheres and from the shield bonus at
  the end of each mission.</p>

  <p>Money can be used to upgrade the Firefly and purchase
  additional ammunition for weapons. Items can be purchased from a
  shop on the Intermission screen.</p>

  <dl>
  <dt>Temporary Upgrades</dt>

  <dd>
    Temporary upgrades are used to boost the Firefly's ability to
    be powered up. For example, at the start of the game the
    Firefly can only be powered up to fire two plasma bolts are
    once. By purchasing an upgrade for the Firefly, you can allow
    for power ups to enable you to fire a maximum of up to five
    plasma bolts at once. Note that this only affects power ups and
    these will still be ammunition limited. To upgrade your default
    weapon, you will need permanent power ups (see below).
  </dd>

  <dt>Permanent Upgrades</dt>

  <dd>
    These power ups are more expensive than temporary upgrades, but
    are permanent. Whereas a temporary upgrade requires you to make
    use of power ups on an ammunition limited base, permanent power
    ups are not limited. This is highly useful when facing heavily
    shielded and tough opponents, with no means of getting plasma
    ammo or transports in sight! When you power up your permanent
    weapon, your powered up weapon level will also be automatically
    upgraded if it is less powerful than your new current power up
    level.When the Firefly's Primary Weapon has been upgraded to
    its maximum output (3 plasma cannons) the player can toggle the
    output type by pressing Shift. The output type can either be
    Concentrate (the default firing type) or Spread. Various
    situations can call for varying the output type.
  </dd>

  <dt>Secondary Weapons</dt>

  <dd>
    As well as primary weapons and temporary upgrades, the Firefly
    is also capable of using a secondary weapon. At the start of
    the game this is a rocket launcher. Like the other weapons in
    the game this can be upgraded by purchasing a new weapon from
    the shop. At the start of the game, a Double Rocket Launcher
    and Micro Rocket Launcher are available for purchase. Secondary
    weapons are used in the same way the rocket launcher is used
    (Space to fire). However the Laser Cannon and Charge Cannon
    work differently.Neither the Charge Cannon or the Laser Cannon
    are ammunition limited (unlike the other rocket based weapons).
    The Charge Cannon works by the player holding down the Space
    bar and releasing it. A meter at the bottom of the screen shows
    how much charge has been built up. The Laser Cannon works by
    the player holding down the Space bar to fire a stream of laser
    fire. It is prone to overheating and must be allowed to cool
    after usage.
  </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Certain weapons and upgrades will not be available to you
  until later in the game.</p>

  <h2>Item Spheres</h2>

  <p>When an enemy craft is destroyed they will sometimes release
  ammo and cash spheres. Certain enemy craft will release power up
  spheres that can give your weapon a temporary boost. The
  following are spheres that can be picked up during missions:</p>

  <table summary="Description of all item spheres.">
    <tr>
      <td><img src="dollar.png" alt="Cash"></td>
      <td><b>Cash</b> - Provides you with cash.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><img src="rocket.png" alt="Plasma Ammo"></td>
      <td><b>Plasma Ammo</b> - Increases your current plasma ammo.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><img src="rocketAmmo.png" alt="Rocket Ammo"></td>
      <td><b>Rocket Ammo</b> - Increases your current rocket ammo.</td>
    </tr>

      <td><b>Shield Sphere</b> - Replenishes your shield reserves.</td>
    </tr>

      <td><b>Plasma Power</b> - Boosts your plasma power.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td><b>Plasma Ouput</b> - Boosts the amount of plasma shots you can fire.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><img src="plasmaRate.png" alt="Plasma Coolor"></td>
      <td><b>Plasma Cooler</b> - Increases your plasma firing rate.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><img src="superCharge.png" alt="Super Charge"></td>
      <td><b>Super Charge</b> - Five way spread, massive power and cooling (rare).</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Cut Scenes</h2>

  <p>During the course of the game mini cut scenes will be shown
  after certain missions. These scenes serve to extend the plot of
  the game and provide the player with gameplay tips. If you wish
  to skip a cut scene press Escape. It is advised that you only
  skip cut scenes if you have already seen them.</p>

  <h2>Ending the Game</h2>

  <p>The game is over when the Firefly's shield units are reduced
  to 0 (zero), or a Primary Mission objective is failed. At this
  point, you will see the Game Over screen. To continue, press Ctrl
  or Space. You will then be taken back to the title screen. In
  certain missions the game will end if Sid Wilson is killed.</p>

  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>Parallel Realities started off writing games on the Amiga
  using AMOS and then, later, Blitz Basic 2. Games written included
  the BOTSS Trilogy and most notably TANX Squadron. TANX Squadron
  was awarded Amiga Format's contributor prize of the month in the
  summer of 1999. Project: Starfighter originally started life on
  the Amiga but was never completed. Development began again for
  Linux in 2002 with this being our first C program. The game
  matured quickly from the initial ideas and this is the finished
  product. We do hope you enjoy playing it.</p>
